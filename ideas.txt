For Priority Scheduling:

Done in Ready Queue
1. order ready queue based on priority (similar to how we order sleeper queue).
2. when trying to run, if lock needs to be acquired (and used by someone else),
	give "someone else" current priority and set their prior_priority to what they had. 
3. When releasing a lock, always set priority to prior priority.
